#  EVENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## OverView ##

The Event Management System is a web application designed to facilitate the creation, management, and registration of events. The backend is built using Spring Boot with a MySQL database, while the frontend is developed using React. This project aims to provide a user-friendly interface for users to manage events and for attendees to register for these events.

## Features ##

- ### User Authentication:  Secure login and registration for users.
- ### Event Creation:   Users can create and manage events.
- ### Attendee Registration: Open registration for attendees to join events.
- ### Event Listing: List of all available events
- ### Responsive Design: User-friendly interface that works on both desktop and mobile devices.

## What I Learned ##

This was my first time building a cross language application, so it was simultaneously challenging and rewarding. I also worked with Spring Security this time, and initially faced some difficulties, but was able to overcome them eventually. Overall this was a very enjoyable web app to make.
